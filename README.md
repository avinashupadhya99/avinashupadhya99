### Hi there, I am Avinash ðŸ‘‹

I love anything DevOps and Cloud. Currently learning k8s through [Civo Academy](https://www.civo.com/academy) and tons of other resources.

I am a senior in college and currently working at Hashedin by Deloitte. I participate in hackathons over the weekends and love being part of communities.

I am also a Postman Student Leader and an AngelHack ambassador. Currently organising [Hack The World](https://hacktheworld.online/?1)
